# World Layoffs Project

Welcome to the World Layoffs Project! This project showcases my skills in data cleaning using MySQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset used in this project contains information about layoffs across various industries and companies worldwide. 

## Key Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Creating a Copy of Data**
   - To ensure the integrity of the original dataset, I created a copy before performing any data cleaning operations. This practice safeguards the main data from any accidental modifications and provides a backup for reference.

2. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Duplicate records can skew analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions. I identified and removed duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure that each record is unique, thereby maintaining the accuracy of the data.

3. **Standardizing Data (TRIM)**
   - Inconsistent data formats can cause issues in analysis. I standardized the dataset by using the TRIM function to remove leading and trailing spaces from text fields. This step ensures consistency and improves data quality.

4. **Removing Null Values**
   - Null values can disrupt analysis and lead to misleading results. I systematically identified and removed null values from the dataset, ensuring that the data used for EDA is complete and reliable.

5. **Removing Useless Columns**
   - To enhance query performance and streamline the dataset, I removed columns that were deemed unnecessary for analysis. This step not only speeds up queries but also focuses the analysis on relevant data points.
